# Financial Data Analysis and Target Column Creation

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing and cleaning financial market data. The dataset includes various financial indicators, and the goal is to preprocess the data and derive a target variable (`Y`) for further analysis or modeling.

## Features
- Load and explore financial datasets with Pandas.
- Data cleaning: handle missing values, format column names, and remove metadata rows.
- Creation of a custom target column (`Y`) based on specific business logic.
- Debugging process walkthrough for common errors like `KeyError`.
- Insights and lessons learned during the process.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes financial indicators such as:
- **XAU BGNL Currency**: Historical gold rates.
- **DXY Currency**: US dollar index.
- Various commodity and index values.

This dataset requires preprocessing to extract meaningful insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1tony0/financial-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd financial-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Process
### 1. Load the Dataset
- Use Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
- Preview the data with `df.head()` and check column names with `df.columns`.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Remove metadata rows and columns with missing or irrelevant values.
- Strip spaces and fix formatting issues in column names.

### 3. Debugging Errors
- Resolve issues like `KeyError` when accessing non-existent columns.
- Use `print(df.columns)` and data exploration techniques to identify problems.

### 4. Creating the `Y` Column
- Derive the target variable `Y` using domain-specific logic.
  Example:
  ```python
  df['Y'] = df['Known_Column'].apply(lambda x: 'High' if x > 100 else 'Low')
  ```
- Validate the distribution of `Y` using `df['Y'].value_counts()`.

## Challenges and Debugging
### Key Issues Faced:
1. **KeyError: 'Y'**  
   - Resolved by checking the dataset for missing or misspelled columns.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed metadata rows using slicing and reset the DataFrame index.

3. **Missing Logic for `Y`**  
   - Developed a clear transformation function for creating the target column.

### Lessons Learned:
- Always explore the dataset structure thoroughly before coding.
- Debugging is an essential part of the data analysis process.

---

## Results
- Successfully cleaned the dataset for analysis.
- Created a meaningful target column (`Y`) for modeling purposes.
- Insights into the debugging process that can help others avoid common pitfalls.
